# Crowdfunding_ETL
DU Data Analytics Project 2 (May 2024)

## Purpose
A collaborative extract-transform-load ("ETL") mini project, which involved building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After data transformation, four CSV files were created with the file data informing the creation of an ERD and a table schema. Finally, the CSV file data was loaded into a Postgres SQL database.
