# Crowdfunding_ETL
DU Data Analytics Project 2 | May 2024
Peter Lovberg & Andrew Mack

## Purpose
A collaborative extract-transform-load ("ETL") mini project, which involved building an ETL pipeline with Python, Pandas and PostgresSQL. Through data transformation of Excel data in a Jupyter Notebook, four CSV files were created, which formed the basis for an ERD and table schema. Finally, the CSV file data was loaded into a Postgres SQL database (see screenshots of database tables).

## Summary of Instructions
